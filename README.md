Salsify Connect
===============

Magento Extension for the Salsify Product Content Management system.


Requirements
==========================

## Magento Versions Supported

Currently Salsify Connect only supports Magento 1.7.x.

1.6.x is very likely to work, but it has not been tested.

1.5 and below definitely do _not_ work, as Salsify Connect depends on the newer Magento ImportExport API.


Installing
==========

## Modman

Under Settings -> Developer -> Template Settings -> Allow Symlinks
